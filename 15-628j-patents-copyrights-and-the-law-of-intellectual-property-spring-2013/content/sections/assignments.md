{{< anchor "psa" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Patent Search Assignment
-----------------------------------------------------------

For this assignment, each of you is being provided with a different recently issued U.S. Patent, and you are being asked to perform a preliminary patent search to assess the validity of Claim 1 (only) of the patent. Do not spend more than four hours on the search itself. What you should look for is prior-art patents that could possibly render your assigned patent invalid because of lack of novelty (ยง 102), or because of obviousness (ยง 103), or possibly both. You need to pay attention to the dates of your assigned patent and of the patents you search among in order to find prior art within the meaning of the statute.

You should then summarize your search in a two-to-three-page report, explaining what the results of your search has led you to conclude about the novelty and the non-obviousness of your assigned patent, and why.

We will also ask for volunteers to make 10-minute oral presentations of their reports during class in addition to turning in written reports. Students who make oral presentations will receive additional credit.
